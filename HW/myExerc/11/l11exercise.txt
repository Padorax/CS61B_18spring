C
1. It needs to implement the methods with 'abstract' in front of them.
Yes it has to. Unless the methods are implemented by other class that inherites the sub interface.
2. No. An abstract class can be subclassed, not superclassed.
3. A class that is not in a named package is in an unnamed package(default package). Thus the full class name is Main.
It's impossible to import classes from an unnamed package.
Unnamed package is usually for test coding or beginners.

B
1. Yes.
Tree bark.
 A class can extends only one class but can implements multiple interfaces. A class can also have extends and implements at the same time.
(Reason: multiple interfaces means we can classify this class into different types; However, if we inheritant from multiple superclass, we are doing some kinds of 'Hybration' between different speicies, which is not allowed.)
