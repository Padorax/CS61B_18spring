C level
1.
1) Dog(determined by the signature of Dog.maxDog)
2) first line (When assign the second line, the compiler will ask"is a Dog a ShowDog?", the answer is not always, so our conservative compiler yells.)
3)	Static	Dynamic
o	Object	Dog
d	Dog	Dog
stuff	Object	Array

2.An interface cannot extend a class.

3.The interface is kind of an abstraction. We use the methods from interface, the implementation details is in downward class.
When we inheritance a class, we want to add additional methods in the subclass.

B level
1.No. There is no default constructor available in 'Dog'
public class Poodle extends Dog{
 public Poodle(int x) {
    super(x);
 }
}

2.Cannot compile: Monkey cannot be converted to a Dog(we can only cast down or cast up)

3.Compiles but Raise ClassCastException: Monkey cannot be cast to Dog
